# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. Changes are listed in random order of importance.

## [3.4.3] - 05-2023

* fix platform profiler compilation bugs
* Svelto.Console improvements
* Improve the new stream related classes. They are used successfully in my current project, unfortunately no much doc available yet
* few FasterList improvements

## [3.4.0] - 03-2023

* removed static caches used in performance critical paths as they were causing unexpected performance issues (the fetching of static data is slower than i imagined)
* add Native prefix in front of the native memory utilities method names
* largely improved the console logger system
* minor improvements to the platform profiler structs
* improvements to the ThreadSafeObjectPool class (some refactoring too)
* added several datastructures previously belonging to Svelto.ECS
* all the FastClear methods are gone. The standard clear method now is aware of the type used and will clear it in the fastest way possible
* MemClear is added in case memory needs to be cleared explicitly
* added new SveltoStream, Unmanaged and Managed stream classes, their use case will be documented one day
* renamed the Svelto.Common.DataStructures namespace to Svelto.DataStructures
* added FixedTypedArray* methods. Fixed size arrays embedded in structs are now possible
* FasterList extension to convert to Span and ByteSpan
* Fix reported bugs
* Minor Svelto Dictionary improvements
* Added ValueContainer, a simple int, TValue dictionary based on sparse set. It has very specific use cases at the moment. Mainly to be used for the new ECS OOP Abstraction resoruce manager


## [3.3.0] - 04-2022

Note: this is quite a big release, so I'm not going to list every single change.

* improved HashHelper algorithm
* added Burst compatible NativeRefWrapperType
* added utility functions to know if a type is unmanaged
* FasterList: removed the confusing ExpandTo, the new methods are now called: SetCountTo and EnsureCountIsAtLeast
* Fixed FasterListEnumerator bug
* Made FasterDictionary easier to debug
* FasterDictionary: Renamed GetOrCreate to GetOrAdd to use similar names to the ConcurrentDictionary methods
* FasterDictionary: Added RecycleOrAdd methods
* FasterDictionary: deleted the confusing ResizeTo method the new methods are now: EnsureCapacity and IncreaseCapacityBy
* Made SveltoDictionary easier to debug
* SveltoDictionary: Similar changes to FasterDictionary
* SveltoDictionary: slightly improve performance
* Tons of other optimizations and bug fixes~~~~

## [3.2.0]

* ICompositionRoot OnContextDestroyed now receive a flag to know if the OnContextInitialized ever had the chance to be called
* Fix some naming case issues, not following the Svelto convention
* Improve FasterList interface
* Add Intersect/Exclude/Union methods to FasterDictionary to work with Sets
* Improve all the SveltoDictionary and derivates interfaces
* Changed (again and still not final) the logic behind the PlatformProfiler markers
* Refactor MemoryUtilities functionalities

## [3.1.3]

### Fixed

* fixed serious mistake in the RefWrapper equality logic that could affect certains kind of keys in the new FasterDictionary (most notable strings)

## [3.1.0]

### Changed

* UnityContext class won't call OnContextDestroyed on application quit
* RefWrapper, which is the way to have always struct keys in a fasterdictionary, now implicitly converts to the reference type it refers to
* Added a property to know if an IBuffer implementation buffer is valid
* FasterDictionary now wraps SveltoDictionary
* FasterDictionary doesn't accept reference types as key anymore, use RefWrapper to convert them
* renamed FasterDictionaryNode to SveltoDictionaryNode
* removed string based pools from the ObjectPool class
* added a very simple implementation of a sparseset

### Fixed
